## 3 Part R Coursework on Machine Learning

###  Part 1. 
In the first part you will be given data collected from various individuals on several variables. The goal will be to use unsupervised learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis or Cluster Analysis to summarise the information in the data by appropriate tables and/or plots.

This will be done through the usage of the EWCS dataset

**Task:**
Visualise and describe the data via unsupervised learning methods. 


### Part 2. 
In the second part you will be presented with a regression problem. The aim would be to compare various models and techniques for their estimation to allow meaningful interpretation and competitive predictive performance. The latter should be assessed by appropriate experiments based on training and test datasets. In addition to linear regression, Tree based methods, Non-linear models or other suitable techniques can be used if you think they can provide improvement.

This will be done through the usage of the Student Performance Dataset

**Task:**
Build a regression model for the variable G3 (final grade) without using the variables G1 and G2. Interpret the model and assess its predictive performance. 


### Part 3. 
Finally, in the third part you will be given a classification problem. The analysis will contain similar steps with the second part but you should be able to interpret the output from different models and compare their predictive performance taking into account that the response variable will be binary. In addition to appropriate regression or discriminant analysis, Tree-based methods, Non-linear models or other suitable techniques can be used if you think they will perform better.

This will be done through the usage of the Bank Marketing Dataset

**Task:**
Build a Classification model to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable Y). Interpret the model and assess its predictive performance.
